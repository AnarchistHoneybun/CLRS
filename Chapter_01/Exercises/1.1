1. Sorting: Finding ranks of competitors in a competitive programming competition, Convex Hull: Determining how to effectively cordon off a large area, eg a farm or a powerplant

2. Other than speed, program efficiency can be measured by amount of memory it utilises (space complexity for more technical people) whereby we can check how much more space, over the input material, the program ends up using.

3. Example data structure -> Linked lists
    Pros: Arbitrary size scaling
    Cons: Slower access time

4. Shortest path and travelling salesman
    Similarities: Both involve minimizing net distance travelled over a certain network of nodes
    Differences: Shortest path has one start and a seperate end point (for non trivial cases) whereas travelling salesman works with the same start and end points and an arbitrary number of nodes to be visited in between

5. Requires exact/best solution: Shortest path
    Can work with an approximate solution: Travelling salesman
