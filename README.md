# Introduction to Algorithms
## by Thomas Cormen, Charles Leiserson, Ronald Rivest and Clifford Stein

This repo contains (aims to, rather) the solutions to exercises and problems to the book  
*Introduction to Algorithms, 3rd Edition, Eastern Economy Edition* 
ISBN *9788120340077*

I'm trying to go through the entire book, so at any given point of time solutions to problems/exercises that appear earlier than the latest one aim to be complete.
