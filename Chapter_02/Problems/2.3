a. θ(n)

b. N_Horner(A,x)
    y = 0
    for i = 1 to A.length
        m = 1
        for j = 1 to i-1
            m = m*x
        y = y + A[i]*m
    
    this naive approach has a runtime of θ(n^2). clearly worse than the θ(n) runtime of standard Horner's rule.

c. too many symbols, refer this https://atekihcan.github.io/CLRS/02/P02-03/

d. Trivially true through the loop invariant analysis in part c
